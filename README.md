# About the project

**AffineTransform** grew up from an academic project for computer graphics course. It was supplemented by intuitive UI based on material design principles and comprehensive theoretical reference (now in progress).

### Why Angular?

Being an one-page web application, **AffineTransform** has a structure which is based at the component scheme. **Angular 2** is one of the best front-end frameworks implementing component based project structure and delivering app-like experiences.

The app loads quickly with the Component Router, which delivers automatic code-splitting so users only load code required to render the view they request.

One of the most important features of Angular 2 is **TypeScript**. In modern web-development it is the best way of building applications with non-trivial structure and complex logic.  It is indispensable in implementing some math based things which mostly require object oriented paradigm.



# Features

- common 2d/3d projective and affine transformations visualization
- intuitive interface and control
- setting up custom camera position in 3d (wip)
- wide theoretical reference with all required math basics (wip)
- programming features and tips wiki (wip)



# Setup and launch

To launch the app clone **master** repository and run

``` shell
npm install
npm start
```

(**node** should be installed)
